# Learning Node.js

I'm in the process of learning Node.js, and this repository will track my progress and projects.

## Why Node.js?

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that's great for building web applications and APIs. I'm excited to explore its capabilities.

## Learning Resources

I'm using online tutorials, documentation, and books to learn Node.js. Here are some resources I've found helpful:

- [Node.js Official Documentation](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Node.js Tutorial on MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs)

Feel free to share any additional resources or tips!

## Projects

As I learn, I'll work on small projects to apply what I've learned. You can find them in the [Projects](./projects) directory of this repository.

## Contact

If you'd like to connect or have any suggestions, you can reach me on [GitHub](https://github.com/YourUsername).
